# Lesson 01

In this lesson we will learn how to create a Virtual Cloud Network (VPC) where our resources (Virtual Server Instances, etcc) will be created.

## What is a Virtual Private Cloud?

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a fundamental networking service on the IBM Cloud platform that provides a secure and isolated environment for your cloud resources. It allows you to create and manage your own private network, providing a high degree of control over your cloud infrastructure.

### Key Features:

* **Isolation**: VPCs create a private, logically isolated network where you can deploy your virtual machines, containers, and other cloud resources. This isolation enhances security and data privacy.

* **Customization**: With VPC, you can define your network's IP address ranges, subnets, and routing rules. This level of customization enables you to design a network that aligns with your specific requirements.

* **Security**: IBM Cloud VPC includes robust security features, such as security groups and network access controls, to protect your resources from unauthorized access and threats.

* **Scalability**: VPCs are highly scalable, allowing you to expand your network as your business grows. You can add or remove resources within your VPC with ease.

* **Global Reach**: IBM Cloud VPCs can span multiple regions, enabling you to build a global network infrastructure that serves your users and applications wherever they are located.

In this README, we will provide the method to create a VPC via Terraform.
